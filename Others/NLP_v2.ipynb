Let's break down the Transformer method step by step to understand how it works and why it's so effective.\n","\n","1. Background and Core Idea\n","Transformers, introduced in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al., revolutionized NLP by focusing entirely on attention mechanisms, moving away from the recurrent layers used in previous models. The core idea is to enable the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when predicting each part of the output sequence, making it highly efficient for learning long-range dependencies.\n","\n","2. Architecture Overview\n","The Transformer model consists of two main parts: the Encoder and the Decoder.  \n","\n","  - Encoder: It processes the input sequence and encapsulates the information into a set of vectors (one for each input token). The encoder is composed of a stack of identical layers, each with two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a fully connected feed-forward network.\n","\n","  - Decoder: It generates the output sequence, token by token, using the encoded information. Like the encoder, the decoder is also made up of a stack of identical layers. However, each layer in the decoder has three sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism, a multi-head attention mechanism over the encoder's output, and a fully connected feed-forward network.\n","\n","3. Attention Mechanism\n","The key innovation in Transformers is the attention mechanism, particularly the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input data relative to each other.\n","\n","  - Self-Attention: This mechanism helps the model to look at other positions in the input sequence for understanding a word in a better way.\n","\n","  - Multi-Head Attention: This consists of multiple attention layers running in parallel, allowing the model to focus on different positions, which enriches its understanding and processing of the sequence.\n","\n","4. Positional Encoding\n","Since Transformers do not inherently process sequence order (unlike RNNs or LSTMs), positional encoding is added to the input embeddings to give the model some information about the order of words in the sentence.\n","\n","5. Training and Optimization\n","Transformers are trained using backpropagation, similar to other deep learning models. They often require significant computing resources, especially for large models intended for general-purpose language understanding.\n","\n","6. Implementation with Python\n","The Hugging Face's Transformers library is a popular choice for implementing Transformer models in Python. It provides pre-trained models that can be used for a wide range of NLP tasks, as well as tools to train your own models.\n","\n","Here's a simple example to get started with the Transformers library:"],"metadata":{"id":"ACraxc-MNEnU"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Q2tIs-4eKMBu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711912989935,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":19435,"user":{"displayName":"Yigit Aydede","userId":"01904022738637465438"}},"outputId":"35677be4-4f38-49f8-a168-a6c592ff0b63"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/huggingface_hub/utils/_token.py:88: UserWarning: \n","The secret `HF_TOKEN` does not exist in your Colab secrets.\n","To authenticate with the Hugging Face Hub, create a token in your settings tab (https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), set it as secret in your Google Colab and restart your session.\n","You will be able to reuse this secret in all of your notebooks.\n","Please note that authentication is recommended but still optional to access public models or datasets.\n","  warnings.warn(\n","Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length.

These models are designed to process sequences of data, such as sentences, making them suitable for NLP tasks. Here's a bit more detail on how they were used:\n","\n","RNNs are a type of neural network designed for processing sequential data. They are called \"recurrent\" because they perform the same task for every element of a sequence, with the output being dependent on the previous computations. This recurrence enables them to maintain information in 'memory' over time, making them suitable for tasks where context is important, like language modeling.\n","\n","In NLP, RNNs were used for a variety of tasks such as:\n","\n","- Language Modeling: Predicting the next word in a sentence based on the previous words.\n","- Text Generation: Generating new text sequences after learning from a corpus.\n","Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another.\n","- Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text.\n","\n","LSTMs are a special kind of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies. They were introduced to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs, particularly issues related to learning long-range dependencies due to problems like vanishing gradients. LSTMs have a complex architecture with a memory cell and multiple gates (input, output, and forget gates) that regulate the flow of information.\n","\n","They improved the performance of NLP systems significantly by being better at capturing context over longer sequences, making them highly effective for:\n","\n","- Text Classification: Classifying texts into predefined categories.\n","- Speech Recognition: Transcribing spoken language into text.\n","- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying key information (names, places, etc.) in text.\n","\n","While RNNs and LSTMs were a significant advancement, they had limitations, especially regarding parallelization and dealing with very long sequences, due to their sequential nature. Transformers were introduced as a solution to these limitations, providing a mechanism (attention) that allows for better handling of long-range dependencies and significantly faster training times thanks to their non-sequential processing capabilities.\n","\n","Transformers and models based on them, like BERT and GPT, have since dominated NLP, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in tasks like language understanding, text generation, and beyond.\n","\n","let's walk through the process of building a simple LSTM model for predicting the next word in a sentence using TensorFlow and Keras.

Eli was the guardian of the lighthouse, a towering beacon that had stood for centuries, guiding sailors safely to shore through treacherous waters.\n","\n","Eli had taken over the duties of lightkeeping from his father, who had received the mantle from his forefathers. The lightkeeping tradition ran deep in Eli's family, back to times when the world was a much larger and more mysterious place. The lighthouse was not just a job for Eli; it was his life. He cared for it as one would care for a family member, ensuring that the light never faltered, for the safety of those at sea depended on it.\n","\n","The townfolk respected Eli for his dedication. However, times were changing. New technologies were emerging, making old ways obsolete. The town council decided that the lighthouse would be automated, deeming a human lightkeeper unnecessary. Eli was devastated. The lighthouse was his home, his purpose, and soon, it would be just a machine, cold and soulless.\n","\n","The night before the lighthouse was to be automated, Eli climbed the spiraling staircase to the top for one last time. He gazed out at the horizon, where the sea kissed the sky, and reflected on the generations of his family who had kept the light burning. He thought of the countless ships that had passed, of the storms weathered, and the lives saved. The lighthouse was more than a structure; it was a symbol of hope, a steadfast sentinel in the face of nature's fury.\n","\n","As Eli watched the sunset, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, a fierce storm began to brew. The winds howled, and the waves crashed against the cliffs with ferocious intensity. It was then that Eli saw a ship in the distance, struggling against the tempest, its course set dangerously close to the rocks.\n","\n","The automated system had not yet been activated, and the town's reliance on technology had left them unprepared for such a sudden storm. Only Eli, with his intimate knowledge of the lighthouse and its workings, could guide the ship to safety.\n","\n","With determination, Eli lit the lamp manually, the warm glow piercing through the storm's darkness. He adjusted the mirrors, focusing the beam to reach the ship, signaling the safe passage through the treacherous waters. The ship corrected its course, guided by the light, and made it safely to the harbor.\n","\n","The next day, the town awoke to the news of the ship's near disaster and Eli's heroic act. The council realized that some traditions, like the human touch in guiding the light, were invaluable. They decided to keep the lighthouse manned by Eli, integrating technology without losing the essence of the lightkeeper's role.\n","\n","Eli continued to man the lighthouse, but now with a new sense of purpose. He understood that change was inevitable, but he also knew that some things, like the human spirit and the tales of old, were timeless. The lighthouse stood not just as a beacon for ships, but as a testament to the light within every person, guiding them through the storms of life.\n","\n","As years passed, Eli became a legend in his own right, the last lightkeeper, a bridge between the old world and the new. He taught the young about the sea, the sky, and the importance of keeping the light alive, both in the lighthouse and within themselves.\n","\n","And so, the lighthouse shone on, a beacon of hope, a guide through darkness, and a reminder of the enduring human spirit, watched over by Eli, the last lightkeeper, who kept the light burning bright against the changing tides of time.\n","\n","The end.\n","\n","In the weeks leading up to the council's decision, Eli spent his days and nights tending to the lighthouse with a heavy heart. He polished the ancient brass fittings until they gleamed like stars, oiled the creaking gears of the light mechanism, and painted the lighthouse's exterior, protecting it from the salty kiss of the sea air. These tasks, once performed with pride and joy, now felt like a farewell to a lifelong friend.\n","\n","One evening, as Eli sat by the hearth in the small keeper's cottage beside the lighthouse, he heard a knock at the door. It was Anna, a young woman from the town who often brought him meals and news from the villagers. She sensed his sorrow and sat with him, listening to his tales of the sea, the ships, and the countless nights spent watching over the waters. Anna, moved by Eli's passion and dedication, decided to help him.\n","\n","Together, they devised a plan to show the town the lighthouse's true value, not just as a beacon of safety but as a symbol of the community's enduring spirit. They organized tours of the lighthouse, inviting people to climb the spiral staircase, feel the ancient stones beneath their fingers, and gaze out at the vast sea from the lantern room. Eli shared stories of the lighthouse's history, of the lives saved by its guiding light, and the beauty of its purpose. The people of the town, young and old, began to see the lighthouse in a new light, appreciating its significance beyond its practical role.\n","\n","The storm that raged on the night before the automation was to take place was unlike any the town had seen in years. Lightning forked across the sky, illuminating the lighthouse in flashes of silver, as Eli, with determined steps, ascended to the lantern room. When he lit the lamp, it was not just a signal to the ship at sea but a beacon calling the town's people to witness the true power of their heritage.\n","\n","After the storm, and the ship was saved, the people rallied with Eli, advocating to keep the lighthouse manned. The council, seeing the unity and spirit of the community, reversed their decision, agreeing that some traditions, especially those that bind a community together, are invaluable.\n","\n","Eli's bond with the town grew stronger through this ordeal. He continued his duties with a renewed spirit, and with Anna's help, he opened the lighthouse to the public, sharing its stories and lessons. The lighthouse became more than a navigational aid; it became a place of gathering, learning, and celebration of the town's maritime heritage.\n","\n","Eli's story spread far and wide, inspiring other coastal communities to reevaluate their connections to their own lighthouses. He became known not just as a lightkeeper but as a keeper of history, tradition, and the collective spirit of a community facing the vast, unknown sea.\n","\n","And so, the lighthouse stood tall and proud, its light a shining testament to the enduring bond between the people and their storied coast. Eli, with Anna by his side, watched over the sea, a guardian of more than just ships, but of the very soul of the town.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Predicting the next sentence\n","\n","We can adapt an LSTM model to predict the next sentence, but this requires a slightly different approach compared to predicting just the next word. Predicting the next sentence involves generating a sequence of words that form a coherent sentence, based on the context provided by a preceding sentence or sequence of text. Here’s how you might approach this:\n","\n","1. Data Preparation: For sentence prediction, your dataset should ideally be structured so that each input sequence (X) is a sentence, and the corresponding target (y) is the next sentence. This involves:\n","\n","  - Tokenizing the text at the sentence level to create pairs of consecutive sentences.\n","  - Further tokenizing each sentence into words, then converting these into sequences of integers using a tokenizer.\n","2. Sequence Padding: Ensure that all input sequences are padded to have the same length for training the LSTM model. This may involve padding each sentence to the length of the longest sentence in your dataset.\n","\n","3. Model Architecture: The model architecture might be similar to the one used for next-word prediction, but with adjustments to handle the complexity of generating full sentences. You could use:\n","\n","  - An Embedding layer for word representations.\n","  - One or more LSTM layers to learn from the sequence data.\n","  - A Dense layer with a softmax activation, outputting probabilities across the vocabulary for each potential next word in the sequence.\n","\n","4. Training\n","Train the model on your prepared dataset. The model learns to predict the sequence of words that form the next sentence based on the input sentence.\n","\n","5. Generating Sentences:\n","  - Start with an input sentence, tokenize it, pad it, and feed it into your trained model.\n","  - The model predicts the next word. Append this word to your input sequence and use it as the new input to predict the following word.\n","  - Continue this process until the model generates a sentence terminator (like a period, question mark, or a custom end-of-sentence token), or until you reach a predetermined sentence length.\n","\n","We can certainly use our own about 1000-word long text to train the model. The process for training the model would remain essentially the same as described previously, but using a longer text can significantly improve the model's understanding of language patterns, potentially leading to better text generation outcomes.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"nPq4ktnWYTip"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","# Initialize the Tokenizer\n","tokenizer = Tokenizer()\n","\n","# Fit the tokenizer on the text\n","tokenizer.fit_on_texts([story_content])\n","\n","# Convert text to a sequence of integers\n","sequence_data = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([story_content])[0]\n","\n","# Vocabulary size (adding 1 because indexing of sequences starts with 1 not 0)\n","vocab_size = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1\n","\n","# Create sequences for each sentence\n","input_sequences = []\n","for i in range(1, len(sequence_data)):\n","    n_gram_sequence = sequence_data[:i+1]\n","    input_sequences.append(n_gram_sequence)\n","\n","# Pad sequences to make them the same length\n","max_sequence_len = max([len(x) for x in input_sequences])\n","input_sequences = np.array(pad_sequences(input_sequences, maxlen=max_sequence_len, padding='pre'))\n","\n","# Split data into input (X) and output (y) parts\n","X = input_sequences[:,:-1]\n","y = input_sequences[:,-1]\n","\n","# Convert output to categorical\n","y = to_categorical(y, num_classes=vocab_size)\n","\n","print(\"Preprocessing Complete.
