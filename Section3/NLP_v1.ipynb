    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are grounded in statistical methods that rely on numerical representations rather than directly using words. LLMs represent the latest advancement in NLP, pushing the boundaries of text processing and generation. Converting text into numbers is a key step in both fields, and one common technique is word embedding. However, the approach to word embeddings in LLMs differs significantly from traditional NLP methods. In this context, we’ll focus on word embeddings specifically within traditional NLP.\n",

    "Word embedding is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers. Conceptually, it involves the mathematical embedding from some space (e.g., the space of all possible words) to a lower-dimensional space of the real numbers. The key idea is to capture the semantic meanings, syntactic similarity, and relation of words in these vectors, such that words with similar meanings are closer to each other in the vector space.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `Word2Vec`\n",
    "- Developed by: Google.\n",
    "- Approach: Predictive model.\n",
    "- Architecture: Uses neural networks with either Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) or Skip-gram models.\n",
    "    - CBOW: Predicts a target word from a window of context words.\n",
    "    - Skip-gram: Predicts context words from a target word.\n",
    "- Training: Trained on large corpora of text, learning to predict words given their context.\n",
    "- Output: Dense vector representations for each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `GloVe`\n",
    "- Developed by: Stanford.\n",
    "- Approach: Count-based model.\n",
    "- Architecture: Constructs a co-occurrence matrix of words from a corpus, then factorizes this matrix to find word vectors.\n",
    "- Training: Uses the statistical information contained in a corpus, specifically the co-occurrence matrix, to find vector representations that capture the probability of word co-occurrences.\n",
    "- Output: Dense vector representations for each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `FastText`\n",
    "- Developed by: Facebook.\n",
    "- Approach: Predictive model with subword information.\n",
    "- Architecture: Similar to Word2Vec (CBOW or Skip-gram), but includes subword (character n-grams) information.\n",
    "- Training: Trains on large corpora of text, learning to predict words given their context, while incorporating subword information.\n",
    "- Output: Dense vector representations for each word, incorporating subword information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand, such as the size of the training data, the importance of handling out-of-vocabulary words, and the computational resources available.\n",

    "#### Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)\n",
    "CBOW predicts the current word based on the context words surrounding it. It uses a sliding window of fixed size to capture the context around the target word. The model learns to predict the target word given the context words.\n",
    "\n",
    "How CBOW works:\n",
    "1. Context Window: Select a context window size (e.g., 2 words on either side of the target word).\n",
    "2. Context Words: For a given target word, identify the words within the context window.\n",
    "3. Prediction: Use the context words as input to predict the target word.\n",
    "Learning: The neural network adjusts its weights to minimize the prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Sentence: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n",
    "- Context window size = 2\n",
    "- Target word = \"brown\"\n",
    "- Context words = [\"The\", \"quick\", \"fox\", \"jumps\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "The CBOW model would take the context words (\"The\", \"quick\", \"fox\", \"jumps\") as input and try to predict the target word \"brown\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Skip-gram\n",
    "Skip-gram, on the other hand, predicts the context words based on the current word. It uses the current word as the input and predicts the surrounding context words.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "1. Context Window: Select a context window size (e.g., 2 words on either side of the target word).\n",
    "2. Target Word: For a given context window, identify the target word.\n",
    "3. Prediction: Use the target word as input to predict the context words.\n",
    "Learning: The neural network adjusts its weights to minimize the prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Sentence: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n",
    "- Context window size = 2\n",
    "- Target word = \"brown\"\n",
    "- Context words = [\"The\", \"quick\", \"fox\", \"jumps\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Skip-gram model would take the target word \"brown\" as input and try to predict the context words (\"The\", \"quick\", \"fox\", \"jumps\").\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison\n",
    "- CBOW: Faster to train, works well with smaller datasets, and averages the context, which can smooth out noise.\n",
    "- Skip-gram: Slower to train but can produce higher-quality embeddings, especially for infrequent words, as it focuses on each context-target pair individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both architectures aim to create word embeddings that capture semantic relationships between words based on their contexts, but they do so in different ways. CBOW predicts the target word from its context, while Skip-gram predicts the context from the target word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how the data looks in CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) using `Word2Vec` with one-hot encoding, let's walk through an example step-by-step.  Suppose we have 5 sentences each has different numbers of words\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with multiple sentences of different lengths in the context of training `Word2Vec` using the CBOW model, the process involves creating context-target pairs for each sentence individually. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "General Approach\n",
    "1. Tokenization: Each sentence is broken down into individual words.\n",
    "2. Vocabulary Creation: A vocabulary of unique words across all sentences is created. Each word is assigned a unique index.\n",
    "3. One-Hot Encoding: Each word in the vocabulary is represented as a one-hot encoded vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CBOW model processes each sentence independently, generating context-target pairs based on the chosen context window size. Let's illustrate this with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Sentences\n",
    "1. \"I love natural language processing.\"\n",
    "2. \"Word2Vec is a popular algorithm.\"\n",
    "3. \"CBOW and Skip-gram are two models.\"\n",
    "4. \"Training word embeddings is important.\"\n",
    "5. \"Handling different sentence lengths.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we tokenize each sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [\"I\", \"love\", \"natural\", \"language\", \"processing\"]\n",
    "2. [\"Word2Vec\", \"is\", \"a\", \"popular\", \"algorithm\"]\n",
    "3. [\"CBOW\", \"and\", \"Skip-gram\", \"are\", \"two\", \"models\"]\n",
    "4. [\"Training\", \"word\", \"embeddings\", \"is\", \"important\"]\n",
    "5. [\"Handling\", \"different\", \"sentence\", \"lengths\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we create a vocabulary (Assume each word is assigned an index based on its order in the vocabulary):\n",
    "\"I\", \"love\", \"natural\", \"language\", \"processing\", \"Word2Vec\", \"is\", \"a\", \"popular\", \"algorithm\", \"CBOW\", \"and\", \"Skip-gram\", \"are\", \"two\", \"models\", \"Training\", \"word\", \"embeddings\", \"important\", \"Handling\", \"different\", \"sentence\", \"lengths\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context-Target Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's create context-target pairs for each sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each sentence, context-target pairs are generated based on the chosen context window size. Let's assume the context window size is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1: \"I love natural language processing.\"\n",
    "1. Target: \"natural\" | Context: [\"I\", \"love\"]\n",
    "2. Target: \"language\" | Context: [\"love\", \"natural\"]\n",
    "3. Target: \"processing\" | Context: [\"natural\", \"language\"]\n",
    "Sentence 2: \"Word2Vec is a popular algorithm.\"\n",
    "1. Target: \"is\" | Context: [\"Word2Vec\"]\n",
    "2. Target: \"a\" | Context: [\"Word2Vec\", \"is\"]\n",
    "3. Target: \"popular\" | Context: [\"is\", \"a\"]\n",
    "4. Target: \"algorithm\" | Context: [\"a\", \"popular\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "And so on.  In the case of sentences with different lengths, the process remains the same. The context-target pairs are generated for each sentence independently. The context window size is applied to each sentence, and the target word is selected from the context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Input Matrix for CBOW\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Context Window: For each target word, we consider a window of context words around it. Let's assume a context window size of 2 for this explanation.\n",
    "2. Context-Target Pairs: Each pair consists of context words as input and a target word as output.\n",
    "3. One-Hot Encoding: Each word in the context and target is represented as a one-hot encoded vector of length equal to the vocabulary size (24 in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Breakdown\n",
    "Given the five sentences and a vocabulary of 24 unique words, let's outline the context-target pairs and how they form the input matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating Context-Target Pairs for the first 2 sentences:\n",
    "Sentence 1: \"I love natural language processing.\"\n",
    "Pairs:\n",
    "1. Target: \"natural\" | Context: [\"I\", \"love\"]\n",
    "2. Target: \"language\" | Context: [\"love\", \"natural\"]\n",
    "3. Target: \"processing\" | Context: [\"natural\", \"language\"]\n",
    "Sentence 2: \"Word2Vec is a popular algorithm.\"\n",
    "Pairs:\n",
    "1. Target: \"is\" | Context: [\"Word2Vec\"]\n",
    "2. Target: \"a\" | Context: [\"Word2Vec\", \"is\"]\n",
    "3. Target: \"popular\" | Context: [\"is\", \"a\"]\n",
    "4. Target: \"algorithm\" | Context: [\"a\", \"popular\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Context Matrix Structure\n",
    "For each context-target pair, the context words are one-hot encoded, and these one-hot encoded vectors are concatenated to form the input matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Pair\n",
    "Pair: Target: \"natural\" | Context: [\"I\", \"love\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot Encoding:  \n",
    "\"I\": [1, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0]\n",
    "\"love\": [0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider each context-target pair as an individual training example, the input (context) matrix for all pairs combined would be structured with each row representing a context word vector and columns representing features (words in the vocabulary).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Scenario\n",
    "Given the same sentence: \"I love natural language processing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Vocabulary size (V) = 10\n",
    "Context window size = 2\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding Representation\n",
    "Assume the indices for one-hot encoding are:\n",
    "\n",
    "I -> [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "love -> [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "natural -> [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",

    "### **It's single layer NN with 100 nodes**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's clarify a bit more about what happens inside Word2Vec.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec, whether using the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) or Skip-Gram model, indeed leverages a neural network architecture, but it's structured a bit differently than a typical feedforward neural network with a single layer of 100 nodes (when you set vector_size=100). The \"100 nodes\" or \"100 dimensions\" represent the size of the word vectors you're aiming to learn, not the nodes of a hidden layer in a traditional sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified overview of the process for both CBOW and Skip-Gram models:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Layer: For CBOW, the input is the context words (multiple words), which are one-hot encoded vectors representing the presence of words in the context. For Skip-Gram, the input is just the target word. The size of each input vector is equal to the vocabulary size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Projection Layer (or Hidden Layer): This is not a typical hidden layer with activation functions. Instead, it's a projection layer where the actual learning of word embeddings happens. When you set vector_size=100, it means this layer will have 100 neurons. The weights connecting the input layer to this layer are what become the word embeddings. In training, for a given input word, the corresponding row in the weight matrix is essentially the word vector for that word.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CBOW, the vectors from the projection layer corresponding to each context word are averaged before being passed to the output layer.\n",
    "In Skip-Gram, the projection layer directly connects to the output layer, using the vector of the input word.\n",
    "Output Layer: The output layer is a softmax layer that makes predictions. For CBOW, it predicts the target word from the context. For Skip-Gram, it predicts the context words from the target word. The size of this layer is also equal to the vocabulary size.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"100 dimensions\" are essentially the weights of the projection layer that you learn during training.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The learning involves adjusting these weights so that the model gets better at its prediction task (predicting context words for Skip-Gram, predicting a target word for CBOW), thereby capturing semantic and syntactic word relationships in the process.\n",
    "The neural network aspect of Word2Vec is quite specialized and optimized for the task of learning word embeddings, which is a bit different from a general-purpose neural network used for other types of prediction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Word2Vec architecture and specifically regarding the projection (or hidden) layer where the word embeddings are learned, the activation function can indeed be thought of as an identity function, $f(x)=x$. This means that the output of each neuron in this layer is the same as its input, without any nonlinear transformation applied."
