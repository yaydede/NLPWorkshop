    "## Explanation:\n",
    "- Class (Account): Defines a blueprint for an Account with attributes owner and balance, and methods like deposit and withdraw.\n",
    "- Object (john_account): An instance of the Account class, representing John's bank account.\n",
    "- Method (deposit, withdraw): Functions defined within a class that operate on objects of that class. For example, deposit adds money to the account's balance.\n",
    "- Attributes (owner, balance): Variables that belong to the object (or class instance). Each account object has its own owner and balance.\n",
    "- Inheritance (SavingsAccount): A derived class that inherits from the Account class and adds a new attribute (interest_rate) and a method (add_interest).\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates the core concepts of OOP in Python: encapsulation (grouping related attributes and methods), inheritance (reusing code in subclasses), polymorphism (methods like __str__), and abstraction (simplifying complex systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "__init__ is a special method in Python classes, also known as a constructor. It is automatically called when a new instance (object) of a class is created. The __init__ method allows you to initialize the attributes of the class with specific values when you create an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points about __init__:\n",
    "- Initialization: __init__ is used to initialize the object's attributes. When you create an instance of a class, __init__ is automatically invoked to set up the initial state of the object.\n",
    "- Self Parameter: The first parameter of __init__ is always `self`, which is a reference to the current instance of the class. This allows you to access the attributes and methods of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not a Constructor in the Traditional Sense: While __init__ is often called a constructor, it technically is an initializer. The actual object creation happens before __init__ is called."
