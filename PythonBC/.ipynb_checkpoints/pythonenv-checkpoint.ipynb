    "# Python Environements\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I’ll outline step-by-step instructions for initiating a Python environment both with Conda and without (using venv), which are two common methods for Python environment management.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you’ll need to install Conda. You can do this by following the instructions on the [Conda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Conda Environment\n",
    "Once you have Conda installed, you can create a new environment using the following command on the command line in your terminal or Anaconda Prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --name myenv python=3.9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new environment named `myenv` with Python 3.9 installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activating the Environment\n",
    "To activate the environment, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Packages\n",
    "To install packages into the environment, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install package_name1 package_name2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deactivating the Environment\n",
    "To deactivate the environment, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Listing Environments\n",
    "To list all the environments, use the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda info --envs\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "For each project and document their environment’s dependencies\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env export > environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing Env\n",
    "To remove an environment, use the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda remove --name myenv --all\n",
    "```\n",
    "## venv\n",
    "This is also know as Python Virtual Environments. The venv module is a built-in module in Python that allows you to create isolated Python environments. It is a simple way to create a virtual environment for your Python projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a venv Environment\n",
    "To create a new venv environment, use the following command on the command line in your terminal or Anaconda Prompt:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m venv myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will create a new environment named `myenv` with Python 3.9 installed.\n",
    "### Activating the Environment\n",
    "To activate the environment, use the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "source myenv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Installing Packages\n",
    "To install packages into the environment, use the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install package_name1 package_name2\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Deactivating the Environment\n",
    "To deactivate the environment, use the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Listing Environments\n",
    "To list all the environments, use the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "find / -name activate 2>/dev/null | grep \"/bin/activate$\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "For each project and document their environment’s dependencies\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
